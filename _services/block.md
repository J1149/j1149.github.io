The `block` message transmits a single serialized block in the format
described in the [serialized blocks section][section serialized blocks].
See that section for an example hexdump.  It can be sent for two
different reasons:

1. **GetData Response:** Nodes will always send it in response to a
   `getdata` message that requests the block with an inventory
   type of `MSG_BLOCK` (provided the node has that block available for
   relay).

2. **Unsolicited:** Some miners will send unsolicited `block` messages
   broadcasting their newly-mined blocks to all of their peers. Many
   mining pools do the same thing, although some may be misconfigured to
   send the block from multiple nodes, possibly sending the same block
   to some peers more than once.
