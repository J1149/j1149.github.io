The `inv` message (inventory message) transmits one or more inventories of
objects known to the transmitting peer.  It can be sent unsolicited to
announce new transactions or blocks, or it can be sent in reply to a
`getblocks` message or `mempool` message.

The receiving peer can compare the inventories from an `inv` message
against the inventories it has already seen, and then use a follow-up
message to request unseen objects.
