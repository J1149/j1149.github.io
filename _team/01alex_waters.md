A capacity to learn and a willingness to take risks led Alex to ultimately work on Bitcoin core as a very early adopter. From there he began to help expand the adoption of the original Bitcoin by running an incubator.

Alex has taken his senior management and technical experience to ultimately run the J1149 platform and expand it in all it's capacity. His flexibility, genuineness and intuition are what draw him to find excellent staff and lead the company forward to an integral future as part of the Project PAI ecosystem.
