The `verifychain` RPC verifies each entry in the local block chain database.

*Parameter #1---how thoroughly to check each block*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Check Level"
  t= "number (int)"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "How thoroughly to check each block, from 0 to 4.  Default is the level set with the `-checklevel` command line argument; if that isn't set, the default is `3`.  Each higher level includes the tests from the lower levels<br><br>Levels are:<br>**0.** Read from disk to ensure the files are accessible<br>**1.**  Ensure each block is valid<br>**2.** Make sure undo files can be read from disk and are in a valid format<br>**3.** Test each block undo to ensure it results in correct state<br>**4.** After undoing blocks, reconnect them to ensure they reconnect correctly"
%}

*Parameter #2---the number of blocks to check*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Number Of Blocks"
  t= "number (int)"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "The number of blocks to verify.  Set to `0` to check all blocks.  Defaults to the value of the `-checkblocks` command-line argument; if that isn't set, the default is `288`"
%}

*Result---verification results*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "bool"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "Set to `true` if verified; set to `false` if verification failed for any reason"
%}

*Example*

Verify the most recent 10,000 blocks in the most through way:

```
pai-cli -testnet verifychain 4 10000
```

Result (took 4 minutes and 25 seconds on a generic PC laptop; it
would've taken much longer on mainnet):

```
true
```

*See also*

* `GetBlockChainInfo`: provides information about the current state of the block chain.
* `GetTxOutSetInfo`: returns statistics about the confirmed unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. Note that this call may take some time and that it only counts outputs from confirmed transactionsâ€”it does not count outputs from the memory pool.
