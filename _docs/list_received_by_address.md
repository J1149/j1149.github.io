*Requires wallet support.*

The `listreceivedbyaddress` RPC lists the total number of pai's received by each address.

*Parameter #1---the minimum number of confirmations a transaction must have to be counted*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Confirmations"
  t= "number (int)"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "The minimum number of confirmations an externally-generated transaction must have before it is counted towards the balance. Transactions generated by this node are counted immediately. Typically, externally-generated transactions are payments to this wallet and transactions generated by this node are payments to other wallets. Use 0 to count unconfirmed transactions. Default is 1"
%}

*Parameter #2---whether to include empty accounts*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Include Empty"
  t= "bool"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "Set to `true` to display accounts which have never received a payment.  Set to `false` (the default) to only include accounts which have received a payment.  Any account which has received a payment will be displayed even if its current balance is `0`"
%}

*Parameter #3---whether to include watch-only addresses in results*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Include Empty"
  t= "bool"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "Set to `true` to display accounts which have never received a payment.  Set to `false` (the default) to only include accounts which have received a payment.  Any account which has received a payment will be displayed even if its current balance is `0`"
%}


*Result---addresses, account names, balances, and minimum confirmations*

*Example*

List addresses with balances confirmed by at least six blocks, including
watch-only addresses:

```
pai-cli -testnet listreceivedbyaddress 6 false true
```

Result (edit to show only two entries):

```
[
    {
        "address" : "PaXVxzkruFZPidQjsDft9CW174Tr99xngu",
        "account" : "test1",
