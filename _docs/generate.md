*Requires wallet support.*

The `generate` RPC nearly instantly generates PAIs.

*Parameter #1---the number of blocks to generate*

| Name    | Type   | Presence                | Description
|---------|--------|-------------------------|-------------
|Blocks | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of blocks to generate.  The RPC call will not return until all blocks have been generated or the maxium number of iterations has been reached

*Parameter #2---the maximum number of iterations to try*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Maxtries"
  t= "number (int)"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "The maximum number of iterations that are tried to create the requested number of blocks. Default is `1000000`"
%}

*Result---the generated PAI header hashes*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "array"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "An array containing the block header hashes of the generated PAIs (may be empty if used with `generate 0`)"
%}

{% include table_content.md
  n= "â†’<br>Header Hashes"
  t= "string (hex)"
  p= "Required<br>(1 or more)"
  d= "The hashes of the headers of the blocks generated in regtest mode, as hex in RPC byte order"
%}

*Example*

Using regtest mode (also works in normal mode), generate 2 blocks:

```
pai-cli -regtest generate 2 500000
```

Result:

```
[
    "36252b5852a5921bdfca8701f936b39edeb1f8c39fffe73b0d8437921401f9af",

]
```
