                        The J1149 blockchain is a fork of Bitcoin due to 
                        the inherent stability of the protocol. Further and significant
                        development has occured on top of the chain of course.

                            The Jekyll theme used here is the Serif theme. Much of the 
                            javascript logic has been ported over for development of the 
                            new site.
