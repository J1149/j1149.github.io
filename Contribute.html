              <p>We are so happy that you are interested in contributing to this site, community, and the world in general.
                    <br /><br />
                Anyone can comment, add vote emojis, or silently lurk on any issue in the J1149 Github [issue tracker](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/issues).
                </p>
                <br /><br />
                <ul>
                  <li>Identify something that you want to improve or suggest an improvement regardless of your coding ability. If it is not tracked in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/issues), add it!</li>
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <li> If you are ready to tackle an item in the issue tracker, we recommend that you discuss the initiative before making an attempt. For large issues: we recommend that you describe your plan in the issue ticket or via the [slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/j1149-pai/shared_invite/enQtNTQ3MzE3OTkxMDEzLWIxNTkzODkwYTdmNjI1YmIxMzExZTk4MjIxNWEwZGVhYjJkMGU5OTc1ZDhmNmM2MjkxNGFjZjVkYThjYTBmODM).</li>
                  <br /><br />
                  <li>You can send issue-solving code via slack, email, postcard, or carrier pigeon. For the technically inclined, we recommend [submitting changes as a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request).</li>
                  <br />
                  Your changes will go live if people generally agree that your improvement is good. Even better, it might be eligible for a bounty! Merged pull request contributors will be added to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/graphs/contributors) and thanked for being very cool.
