title: Data Storage
---

The [Project PAI whitepaper](https://projectpai.com/assets/files/whitepaper/whitepaper-tech.pdf) outlines the importance of data storage, as it relates to Project PAI blockchain implementations.

This idea was formulated into a [data storage and sharing protocol, PDP2](https://github.com/projectpai/pdps/blob/master/pdp-0002.mediawiki).

It has most recently been further articulated with illustrations of data flows in the [PAI data paper](https://projectpai.com/assets/files/whitepaper/data-sharing-protocol.pdf).

A reference implementation of an example client and provider are available in the [projectpai/paicoin codebase](https://github.com/projectpai/paicoin/tree/master/contrib/data-share). Complete with reference APIs for both [clients](https://github.com/projectpai/paicoin/blob/master/contrib/data-share/client_example/README.md) and [providers](https://github.com/projectpai/paicoin/blob/master/contrib/data-share/provider_example/README.md).

The current goal for this section of the website is to provide a hosted interface; where people can submit data to a testnet client and see the results in a testnet block explorer. This initiative is awaiting the completion of the [testnet faucet](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/issues/9) and the [testnet block explorer](https://github.com/J1149/j1149.github.io/issues/11).
