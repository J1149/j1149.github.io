GetAddr
==========

The `getaddr` message requests an `addr` message from the receiving
node, preferably one with lots of IP addresses of other receiving nodes.
The transmitting node can use those IP addresses to quickly update its
database of available nodes rather than waiting for unsolicited `addr`
messages to arrive over time.

There is no payload in a `getaddr` message.  See the [message header
section][section message header] for an example of a message without a payload.
