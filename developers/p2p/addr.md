ADDR
====================

The `addr` (IP address) message relays connection information
for peers on the network. Each peer which wants to accept incoming
connections creates an `addr` message providing its connection
information and then sends that message to its peers unsolicited. Some
of its peers send that information to their peers (also unsolicited),
some of which further distribute it, allowing decentralized peer
discovery for any program already on the network.

An `addr` message may also be sent in response to a `getaddr` message.

| Bytes      | Name             | Data Type          | Description
|------------|------------------|--------------------|----------------
| *Varies*   | IP address count | compactSize uint   | The number of IP address entries up to a maximum of 1,000.
| *Varies*   | IP addresses     | network IP address | IP address entries.  See the table below for the format of a Pai network IP address.

Each encapsulated network IP address currently uses the following structure:

| Bytes | Name       | Data Type | Description
|-------|------------|-----------|---------------
| 4     | time       | uint32    | A time in Unix epoch time format.  Nodes advertising their own IP address set this to the current time.  Nodes advertising IP addresses they've connected to set this to the last time they connected to that node.  Other nodes just relaying the IP address should not change the time.  Nodes can use the time field to avoid relaying old `addr` messages.  <br><br>Malicious nodes may change times or even set them in the future.
| 8     | services   | uint64_t  | The services the node advertised in its `version` message.
| 16    | IP address | char      | IPv6 address in **big endian byte order**. IPv4 addresses can be provided as [IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses][]
| 2     | port       | uint16_t  | Port number in **big endian byte order**.  Note that Pai Core will only connect to nodes with non-standard port numbers as a last resort for finding peers.  This is to prevent anyone from trying to use the network to disrupt non-Pai services that run on other ports.

The following annotated hexdump shows part of an `addr` message. (The
message header has been omitted and the actual IP address has been
replaced with a [RFC5737][] reserved IP address.)
