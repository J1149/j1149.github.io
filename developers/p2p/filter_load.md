FilterLoad
===========

The `filterload` message tells the receiving peer to filter all relayed
transactions and requested merkle blocks through the provided filter.
This allows clients to receive transactions relevant to their wallet
plus a configurable rate of false positive transactions which can
provide plausible-deniability privacy.

| Bytes    | Name         | Data Type | Description
|----------|--------------|-----------|---------------
| *Varies* | nFilterBytes | compactSize uint | Number of bytes in the following filter bit field.
| *Varies* | filter       | uint8_t[] | A bit field of arbitrary byte-aligned size. The maximum size is 36,000 bytes.
| 4        | nHashFuncs   | uint32_t  | The number of hash functions to use in this filter. The maximum value allowed in this field is 50.
| 4        | nTweak       | uint32_t  | An arbitrary value to add to the seed value in the hash function used by the bloom filter.
| 1        | nFlags       | uint8_t   | A set of flags that control how outpoints corresponding to a matched pubkey script are added to the filter. See the table in the Updating A Bloom Filter subsection below.

The annotated hexdump below shows a `filterload` message. (The message
header has been omitted.)  For an example of how this payload was
created, see the [filterload example][section creating a bloom filter].
