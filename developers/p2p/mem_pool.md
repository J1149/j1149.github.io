MemPool
=========

The `mempool` message requests the TXIDs of transactions that the
receiving node has verified as valid but which have not yet appeared in
a block. That is, transactions which are in the receiving node's memory
pool. The response to the `mempool` message is one or more `inv`
messages containing the TXIDs in the usual inventory format.

Sending the `mempool` message is mostly useful when a program first
connects to the network. Full nodes can use it to quickly gather most or
all of the unconfirmed transactions available on the network; this is
especially useful for miners trying to gather transactions for their
transaction fees. SPV clients can set a filter before sending a
`mempool` to only receive transactions that match that filter; this
allows a recently-started client to get most or all unconfirmed
transactions related to its wallet.

The `inv` response to the `mempool` message is, at best, one node's
view of the network---not a complete list of unconfirmed transactions
on the network. Here are some additional reasons the list might not
be complete:

* The `mempool` message is not currently fully compatible with the
  `filterload` message's `BLOOM_UPDATE_ALL` and
  `BLOOM_UPDATE_P2PUBKEY_ONLY` flags. Mempool transactions are not
  sorted like in-block transactions, so a transaction (tx2) spending an
  output can appear before the transaction (tx1) containing that output,
  which means the automatic filter update mechanism won't operate until
  the second-appearing transaction (tx1) is seen---missing the
  first-appearing transaction (tx2). It has been proposed in [Pai
  Core issue #2381][] that the transactions should be sorted before
  being processed by the filter.

There is no payload in a `mempool` message.  See the [message header
section][section message header] for an example of a message without a payload.
