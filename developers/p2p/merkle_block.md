MerkleBlock
============

*Added in protocol version 70001 as described by BIP37.*

The `merkleblock` message is a reply to a `getdata` message which
requested a block using the inventory type `MSG_MERKLEBLOCK`.  It is
only part of the reply: if any matching transactions are found, they will
be sent separately as `tx` messages.

If a filter has been previously set with the `filterload` message, the
`merkleblock` message will contain the TXIDs of any transactions in the
requested block that matched the filter, as well as any parts of the
block's merkle tree necessary to connect those transactions to the
block header's merkle root. The message also contains a complete copy
of the block header to allow the client to hash it and confirm its
proof of work.

| Bytes    | Name               | Data Type        | Description
|----------|--------------------|------------------|----------------
| 80       | block header       | block_header     | The block header in the format described in the [block header section][section block header].
| 4        | transaction count  | uint32_t         | The number of transactions in the block (including ones that don't match the filter).
| *Varies* | hash count         | compactSize uint | The number of hashes in the following field.
| *Varies* | hashes             | char[32]         | One or more hashes of both transactions and merkle nodes in internal byte order.  Each hash is 32 bytes.
| *Varies* | flag byte count    | compactSize uint | The number of flag bytes in the following field.
| *Varies* | flags              | byte[]           | A sequence of bits packed eight in a byte with the least significant bit first.  May be padded to the nearest byte boundary but must not contain any more bits than that.  Used to assign the hashes to particular nodes in the merkle tree as described below.

The annotated hexdump below shows a `merkleblock` message which
corresponds to the examples below.  (The message header has been
omitted.)

Note: when fully decoded, the above `merkleblock` message provided the
TXID for a single transaction that matched the filter. In the network
traffic dump this output was taken from, the full transaction belonging
to that TXID was sent immediately after the `merkleblock` message as
a `tx` message.
