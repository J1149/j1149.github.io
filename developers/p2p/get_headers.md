GetHeaders
=============

The `getheaders` message requests a `headers` message that provides block headers
starting from a particular point in the block chain. It allows a
peer which has been disconnected or started for the first time to get
the headers it hasnâ€™t seen yet.

The `getheaders` message is nearly identical to the `getblocks` message,
with one minor difference: the `inv` reply to the `getblocks` message
will include no more than 500 block header hashes; the `headers` reply
to the `getheaders` message will include as many as 2,000 block headers.
