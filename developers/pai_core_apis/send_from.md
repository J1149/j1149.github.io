SendFrom
=======================

*Requires wallet support. Requires an unlocked wallet or an
unencrypted wallet.*

The sendfrom RPC spends an amount from a local account to a pai address.

**WARNING** `sendfrom` will be removed in a later version of Pai
Core.  Use the RPCs listed in the See Also subsection below instead.

*Parameter #1---from account*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "From Account"
  t= "string"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The name of the account from which the pai's should be spent.  Use an empty string (\"\") for the default account"
%}

*Parameter #2---to address*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "To Address"
  t= "string"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "A P2PKH or P2SH address to which the pai's should be sent"
%}

*Parameter #3---amount to spend*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Amount"
  t= "number (pai's)"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The amount to spend in pai's.  Pai Core will ensure the account has sufficient pai's to pay this amount (but the transaction fee paid is not included in the calculation, so an account can spend a total of its balance plus the transaction fee)"
%}

*Parameter #4---minimum confirmations*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Confirmation"
  t= "number (int)"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "The minimum number of confirmations an incoming transaction must have for its outputs to be credited to this account’s balance. Outgoing transactions are always counted, as are move transactions made with the move RPC. If an account doesn’t have a balance high enough to pay for this transaction, the payment will be rejected. Use 0 to spend unconfirmed incoming payments. Default is 1"
%}

*Parameter #5---a comment*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Comment"
  t= "string"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "A locally-stored (not broadcast) comment assigned to this transaction.  Default is no comment"
%}

*Parameter #6---a comment about who the payment was sent to*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Comment To"
  t= "string"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "A locally-stored (not broadcast) comment assigned to this transaction.  Meant to be used for describing who the payment was sent to. Default is no comment"
%}

*Result---a TXID of the sent transaction*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "string"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The TXID of the sent transaction, encoded as hex in RPC byte order"
%}

*Example from Pai Core 0.10.0*

Spend 0.1 pai's from the account "test" to the address indicated below
using only UTXOs with at least six confirmations, giving the
transaction the comment "Example spend" and labeling the spender
"Example.com":


```
pai-cli -testnet sendfrom "test" \
            mgnucj8nYqdrPFh2JfZSB1NmUThUGnmsqe \
            0.1 \
            6 \
            "Example spend" \
            "Example.com"
```

Result:

```
f14ee5368c339644d3037d929bbe1f1544a532f8826c7b7288cb994b0b0ff5d8
```
