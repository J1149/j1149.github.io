GetPeerInfo
========================

The `getpeerinfo` RPC returns data about each connected network node.

*Parameters: none*

*Result---information about each currently-connected network node*

| Name | Type      | Presence            | Description
|------|-----------|---------------------|-------------
| `result`  | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array of objects each describing one connected node.  If there are no connections, the array will be empty
| →<br>Node | object | Optional<br>(0 or more) | An object describing a particular connected node
| → →<br>`id` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The node's index number in the local node address database
| → →<br>`addr` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The IP address and port number used for the connection to the remote node
| → →<br>`addrlocal` | string | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | Our IP address and port number according to the remote node.  May be incorrect due to error or lying.  Most SPV nodes set this to `127.0.0.1:8333`
| → →<br>`services` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The services advertised by the remote node in its `version` message
| → →<br>`lastsend` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The Unix epoch time when we last successfully sent data to the TCP socket for this node
| → →<br>`lastrecv` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The Unix epoch time when we last received data from this node
| → →<br>`bytessent` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The total number of bytes we've sent to this node
| → →<br>`bytesrecv` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The total number of bytes we've received from this node
| → →<br>`conntime` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The Unix epoch time when we connected to this node
| → →<br>`timeoffset` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | *Added in Pai Core 0.12.0*<br><br>The time offset in seconds
| → →<br>`pingtime` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The number of seconds this node took to respond to our last P2P `ping` message
| → →<br>`minping` | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | *Updated in Pai Core 0.13.0*<br><br>The minimum observed ping time (if any at all)
| → →<br>`pingwait` | number (real) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The number of seconds we've been waiting for this node to respond to a P2P `ping` message.  Only shown if there's an outstanding `ping` message
| → →<br>`version` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The protocol version number used by this node.
| → →<br>`subver` | string | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The user agent this node sends in its `version` message.  This string will have been sanitized to prevent corrupting the JSON results.  May be an empty string
| → →<br>`inbound` | bool | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to `true` if this node connected to us; set to `false` if we connected to this node
| → →<br>`startingheight` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The height of the remote node's block chain when it connected to us as reported in its `version` message
| → →<br>`banscore` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The ban score we've assigned the node based on any misbehavior it's made.  By default, Pai Core disconnects when the ban score reaches `100`
| → →<br>`synced_headers` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The highest-height header we have in common with this node based the last P2P `headers` message it sent us.  If a `headers` message has not been received, this will be set to `-1`
| → →<br>`synced_blocks` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The highest-height block we have in common with this node based on P2P `inv` messages this node sent us.  If no block `inv` messages have been received from this node, this will be set to `-1`
| → →<br>`inflight` | array | Required<br>(exactly 1) | An array of blocks which have been requested from this peer.  May be empty
| → → →<br>Blocks | number (int) | Optional<br>(0 or more) | The height of a block being requested from the remote peer
| → →<br>`whitelisted` | bool | Required<br>(exactly 1) | Set to `true` if the remote peer has been whitelisted; otherwise, set to `false`.  Whitelisted peers will not be banned if their ban score exceeds the maximum (100 by default).  By default, peers connecting from localhost are whitelisted
| → →<br>`bytessent_per_msg` | string : <br>object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | *Added in Pai Core 0.13.0*<br><br>Information about total sent bytes aggregated by message type
| → → →<br>Message Type | number(int) | Required<br>(1 or more) | Total sent bytes aggregated by message type. One field for every used message type
| → →<br>`bytesrecv_per_msg` | string : <br>object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | *Added in Pai Core 0.13.0*<br><br>Information about total received bytes aggregated by message type
| → → →<br>Message Type | number (int) | Required<br>(1 or more) | Total received bytes aggregated by message type. One field for every used message type

* `GetNetTotals`: returns information about network traffic, including bytes in, bytes out, and the current time.
* `GetNetworkInfo`: returns information about the node’s connection to the network.
