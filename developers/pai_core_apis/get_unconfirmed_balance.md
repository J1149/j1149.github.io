GetUnconfirmedBalance
========================

*Requires wallet support.*

The `getunconfirmedbalance` RPC returns the walletâ€™s total unconfirmed balance.

*Parameters: none*

*Result---the balance of unconfirmed transactions paying this wallet*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "number (pai's)"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The total number of pai's paid to this wallet in unconfirmed transactions"
%}

*Example from Pai Core 0.10.0*

```
pai-cli -testnet getunconfirmedbalance
```

Result (no unconfirmed incoming payments):

```
0.00000000
```
