SignRawTransaction
=======================

The `signrawtransaction` RPC signs a transaction in the serialized transaction format using private keys stored in the wallet or provided in the call.

`WARNING: signrawtransaction will be removed in a later version of Pai Core.`

*Parameter #1---the transaction to sign*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Transaction"
  t= "string (hex"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The transaction to sign as a serialized transaction"
%}

*Parameter #2---unspent transaction output details*

| Name | Type      | Presence            | Description
|------|-----------|---------------------|-------------
| Dependencies  | array | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | The previous outputs being spent by this transaction
| →<br>Output | object | Optional<br>(0 or more) | An output being spent
| → →<br>`txid` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The TXID of the transaction the output appeared in.  The TXID must be encoded in hex in RPC byte order
| → →<br>`vout` | number (int) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The index number of the output (vout) as it appeared in its transaction, with the first output being 0
| → →<br>`scriptPubKey` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The output's pubkey script encoded as hex
| → →<br>`redeemScript` | string (hex) | Optional<br>(0 or 1) | If the pubkey script was a script hash, this must be the corresponding redeem script


*Parameter #3---private keys for signing*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Private Keys"
  t= "array"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "An array holding private keys.  If any keys are provided, only they will be used to sign the transaction (even if the wallet has other matching keys).  If this array is empty or not used, and wallet support is enabled, keys from the wallet will be used"
%}

*Parameter #4---signature hash type*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "SigHash"
  t= "string"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "The type of signature hash to use for all of the signatures performed.  (You must use separate calls to the `signrawtransaction` RPC if you want to use different signature hash types for different signatures.  The allowed values are: `ALL`, `NONE`, `SINGLE`, `ALL|ANYONECANPAY`, `NONE|ANYONECANPAY`, and `SINGLE|ANYONECANPAY`"
%}

*Result---the transaction with any signatures made*

| Name | Type      | Presence            | Description
|------|-----------|---------------------|-------------
| `result`  | object | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The results of the signature
| →<br>`hex` | string (hex) | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The resulting serialized transaction encoded as hex with any signatures made inserted.  If no signatures were made, this will be the same transaction provided in parameter #1
| →<br>`complete` | bool | Required<br>(exactly 1) | The value `true` if transaction is fully signed; the value `false` if more signatures are required


*Example from Pai Core 0.10.0*

Sign the hex generated in the example section for the `createrawtransaction`
RPC:

```
pai-cli -testnet signrawtransaction 01000000011da9283b4ddf8d\
89eb996988b89ead56cecdc44041ab38bf787f1206cd90b51e0000000000ffff\
ffff01405dc600000000001976a9140dfc8bafc8419853b34d5e072ad37d1a51\
59f58488ac00000000
```

Result:

```
{
    "hex" : "01000000011da9283b4ddf8d89eb996988b89ead56cecdc44041ab38bf787f1206cd90b51e000000006a47304402200ebea9f630f3ee35fa467ffc234592c79538ecd6eb1c9199eb23c4a16a0485a20220172ecaf6975902584987d295b8dddf8f46ec32ca19122510e22405ba52d1f13201210256d16d76a49e6c8e2edc1c265d600ec1a64a45153d45c29a2fd0228c24c3a524ffffffff01405dc600000000001976a9140dfc8bafc8419853b34d5e072ad37d1a5159f58488ac00000000",
    "complete" : true
}
```

* `CreateRawTransaction`: creates an unsigned serialized transaction that spends a previous output to a new output with a P2PKH or P2SH address. The transaction is not stored in the wallet or transmitted to the network.
* `DecodeRawTransaction`: decodes a serialized transaction hex string into a JSON object describing the transaction.
* `SendRawTransaction`: validates a transaction and broadcasts it to the peer-to-peer network.
