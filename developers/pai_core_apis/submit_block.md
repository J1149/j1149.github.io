SubmitBlock
=======================

The `submitblock` RPC accepts a block, verifies it is a valid addition to the block chain, and broadcasts it to the network. Extra parameters are ignored by Pai Core but may be used by mining pools or other programs.

*Parameter #1---the new block in serialized block format as hex*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Block"
  t= "string (hex)"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The full block to submit in serialized block format as hex"
%}

*Parameter #2---additional parameters*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Parameters"
  t= "object"
  p= "Optional<br>(0 or 1)"
  d= "A JSON object containing extra parameters.  Not used directly by Pai Core and also not broadcast to the network.  This is available for use by mining pools and other software.  A common parameter is a `workid` string"
%}

*Result---`null` or error string*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "null/string"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "If the block submission succeeded, set to JSON `null`.  If submission failed, set to one of the following strings: `duplicate`, `duplicate-invalid`, `inconclusive`, or `rejected`.  The JSON-RPC `error` field will still be set to `null` if submission failed for one of these reasons"
%}

*Example from Pai Core 0.10.0*

Submit the following block with the workid, "test".

```
pai-cli -testnet submitblock 02000000df11c014a8d798395b5059c\
722ebdf3171a4217ead71bf6e0e99f4c7000000004a6f6a2db225c81e77773f6\

650f529332c47646dac00000000 \
'{ "workid": "test" }'
```

Result (the block above was already on a local block chain):

```
duplicate
```
