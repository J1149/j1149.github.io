GenerateToAddress
========================

*Requires wallet support.*

The `generatetoaddress` RPC mines blocks immediately to a specified address.

*Parameter #1---the number of blocks to generate*

{% include table_header.md 
  n="Blocks" 
  t="number (int)" 
  p="Required<br>(exactly 1)" 
  d="The number of blocks to generate.  The RPC call will not return until all blocks have been generated or the maxium number of iterations has been reached" 
%}

*Parameter #2---an address (P2PKH or P2SH)*

{% include table_header.md 
  n="Address" 
  t="string (base58)" 
  p="Required<br>(exactly 1)" 
  d="The address to send the newly generated pai to"
%}

*Parameter #3---the maximum number of iterations to try*

{% include table_header.md 
  n="Maxtries" 
  t="number (int)" 
  p="Optional<br>(0 or 1)" 
  d="The maximum number of iterations that are tried to create the requested number of blocks.  Default is `1000000`" 
%}

*Result---the generated block header hashes*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "array"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "An array containing the block header hashes of the generated blocks (may be empty if used with `generate 0`)"
%}

{% include table_content.md
  n= "â†’<br>Header Hashes"
  t= "string (hex)"
  p= "Required<br>(1 or more)"
  d= "The hashes of the headers of the blocks generated, as hex in RPC byte order"
%}

*Example*

Using regtest mode, generate 2 blocks with maximal 500000 iterations:

```
pai-cli -regtest generatetoaddress 2 "PaXVxzkruFZPidQjsDft9CW174Tr99xngu\
eBdYAyTMXW75" 500000
```

Result:

```
[
    "36252b5852a5921bdfca8701f936b39edeb1f8c39fffe73b0d8437921401f9af",
    "5f2956817db1e386759aa5794285977c70596b39ea093b9eab0aa4ba8cd50c06"
]
```
