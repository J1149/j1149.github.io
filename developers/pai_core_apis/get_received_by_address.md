GetReceivedByAddress
========================

*Requires wallet support.*

The `getreceivedbyaddress` RPC returns the total amount received by the specified address in transactions with the specified number of confirmations. It does not count coinbase transactions.

*Parameter #1---the address*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "Address"
  t= "string"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The address whose transactions should be tallied"
%}

*Parameter #2---the minimum number of confirmations*

*Result---the number of pai's received*

{% include table_header.md
  n= "`result`"
  t= "number (pai's)"
  p= "Required<br>(exactly 1)"
  d= "The number of pai's received by the address, excluding coinbase transactions.  May be `0`"
%}

*Example from Pai Core 0.10.0*

Get the pai's received for a particular address, only counting
transactions with six or more confirmations:

```
pai-cli -testnet getreceivedbyaddress mjSk1Ny9spzU2fouzYgLqGUD8U41iR35QN 6
```

Result:

```
0.30000000
```
